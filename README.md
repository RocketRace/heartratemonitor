A simple Android app that connects to Polar heart rate devices, and collects ECG data from them. The benefit of a custom solution over Polar's own software is to avoid the transmission of medical data through the cloud and perform all processing locally.

Originally developed in 2021 to aid in a PHD project.

This project uses the Polar SDK. For terms of the SDK license, see `POLAR_SDK_LICENSE.md`. For this repository's license, see `LICENSE.md`.
