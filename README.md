A simple Android app that connects to Polar heart rate devices, and collects ECG data from them. The benefit of a custom solution over Polar's own software is to avoid the transmission of medical data through the cloud and perform all processing locally.

Developed in 2021, and used in a number of publications since then. (TODO: link a few)

This project uses the Polar SDK. For terms of the SDK license, see `POLAR_SDK_LICENSE.md`. For the license used in the rest of the repository, see `LICENSE.md`.
